## Project Overview

The **AI-Powered Phishing Detection and Mitigation** system is an advanced security solution designed to **detect and prevent phishing attacks** using cutting-edge AI and machine learning techniques. The system performs real-time analysis on **emails, URLs, and web pages** to identify and mitigate phishing threats effectively, helping organizations safeguard their digital assets.

## Objectives

- Develop an **AI-driven phishing detection system** with high accuracy.
- Integrate **real-time threat intelligence** for enhanced protection.
- Support **scalable deployment** for enterprises of all sizes.
- Provide seamless integration with existing **email security infrastructures**.
- Leverage **adaptive learning** to counter evolving phishing tactics.
- Offer **user behavior analytics** to detect risky patterns.
- Provide detailed **reporting and analytics** for security administrators.

## Key Features

- **Email Analysis**: Utilizes **NLP** and **deep learning** to analyze and detect phishing emails.
- **URL Classification**: Machine learning-based detection of **phishing URLs**.
- **Website Analysis**: Deep learning models analyze web pages to identify **malicious content**.
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Detects abnormal **user behavior** to identify potential threats.
- **Threat Intelligence Integration**: Fetches real-time threat data from **OpenPhish**, **PhishTank**, **VirusTotal**, and more.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Cloud-native, capable of **horizontal scaling** to support large volumes of traffic.
- **Integration Support**: REST APIs for seamless integration with third-party tools like **SIEMs** and **firewalls**.
- **Automated Learning**: Continuously updates detection models based on emerging threats.

## System Architecture

The system is built on a modular, scalable architecture:

1. **Data Ingestion Layer**: Responsible for email processing, URL extraction, and web scraping.
2. **Analysis Engine**: Powered by AI/ML modules, including **NLP**, **ML classifiers**, and **behavioral analysis**.
3. **Integration Layer**: API endpoints for integration, authentication, and logging.
4. **Threat Intelligence Layer**: Connects to multiple external phishing databases for real-time threat data.
5. **User Dashboard**: A comprehensive interface to monitor phishing attempts, generate reports, and analyze threats.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: [HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT]
- **Backend**: [Flask]
- **AI/ML Models**: [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)

## Installation

To get started with the AI-Powered Phishing Detection and Mitigation system, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-repo/ai-phishing-detection.git](https://github.com/shauryasrivastava-1612/AI-Powered-Phishing-detection-and-Mitigation
    cd AI Phishing Detection Frontend and Backend
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    ```
3. Create `requirements.txt` File
The `requirements.txt` file lists the dependencies that need to be installed for the project.

Here‚Äôs an example of a `requirements.txt` file for your project:

```bash
transformers
torch
datasets
scikit-learn
nltk
textstat
seaborn
matplotlib
pandas
flask
fastapi
swifter
```
```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
## Usage

- **Frontend**: Upload and analyze emails or URLs directly via the UI.
- **Backend**: The system processes requests using AI-based detection mechanisms.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Security administrators can view **alerts**, **logs**, and **analytics** to monitor phishing attempts.

## Challenges

- **Reducing False Positives**: Ensuring accurate detection while minimizing false alarms.
- **Evolving Phishing Techniques**: Adapting to the constantly changing methods used by attackers.
- **Real-time Analysis**: Maintaining minimal latency in threat detection and mitigation.
- **Integration with Existing Infrastructure**: Seamless compatibility with existing security systems.

## Future Enhancements

- **AI-based Adversarial Phishing Detection**: Enhancing the model's resilience against adversarial attacks.
- **Advanced Behavioral Analysis**: Leveraging deep learning to analyze complex user behaviors.
- **Browser Extensions**: Real-time phishing warnings during browsing sessions.
- **Mobile App**: A mobile solution for instant phishing detection and threat scanning.
